Structure Splitting & Traversal Example
---------------------------------------
The algorithm for splitting up the data before sending is as
follows:

Foreach data element to process & send:
    *  Scan data structure & tag any non-Atom members
    *  transfer data structure
    *  Process tags sequentially in order tagged.  For each data tag,
       scan & tag non-Atoms and send data element followed by any tags
       contained within.


Consider the following structure definitions:

	struct c {
	    int ci3;
	    Vector_t cv3;
	}

	struct a {
	    int ai1;
	    struct  b  {
		int bi2;
		Vector_t  bv1;
	    }
	    char ac1[16];
	    struct c *asp1;
	    Vector_t av2;
	}

1) struct a is processed.  All non-Atom members are tagged (bv1,asp1,av2)
2) struct a is transferred.
3) Vector bv1 is transferred.
4) Structure tag asp1 is processed.  All non-Atom members are tagged (cv3)
5) structure asp1 is transferred.
6) Vector cv3 is transferred.
7) Vector av2 is transferred.
