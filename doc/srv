THE GEOLINK SERVER
------------------

Each host in a Geolink system has a server process that manages the
connection of application processes.  The server that will be used
in the first release of Geolink, as described in this document, will
only be used to supply connection information.  

The server process is always running as a background task.  It
creates a shared memory region when it starts up and allows other
processes to map this region into their address space as needed. 

It is through this shared memory section that application processes
connect with their host server.

When an application wishes to send data, it first may request from
the server a list of all available destination data services that
are capable of receiving the data.  This request is sent by the
calling application to the server in the form of an executive
request.  This is a special kind of structure sent via the FLPUT routine
that is recognized by the server as a non-data request.  This
interaction with the server is as follows:
