The Connection Server is responsible for connecting Client applications
to the data service that they request.  Clients can make inquirys to
the connection server to:

	* request a list of all data services available.
	* request configuration information about a data service.

Client applications communicate with the Connection Server through
a shared memory region that is created by the Connection Server
process when it starts.  The region is divided into slots so that
multiple clients can share the same shared memory region. (fig n.)

Clients map this region into their address space when
they startup.
