Layers
------
The FinderLink system is implemented as a set of layered routines.
Each layer of has a well defined interface to the layer below it,
and does not does need to know how the layer below actually
implements its functionality.

The advantage of this layered model is that layers can be changed
without adjacent layers being affected.

The layers of are defined as:
	User
	  Data
	    Application
	      Interface
	        Transport

	* The User layer is where all the user interface support is
	provided.  Programs such as the DataMover are implemented at
	this level and provided methods for making data selections
	interactively using a variety of selection strategies such
	as SQL or graphical picking.

	* The Data layer handles the task of actually fetching the
	data requested at the User layer and storing it into data 
	structures.

	* The Application layer provides the interface routines that
	application programmers call to invoke and control data transfers.
	This layer supports the top level PUT & GET interface.

	* The Interface layer is comprised of routines used to implement 
	the application layer.  These routines are the bridge between the
	application layer and the protocol specific, and generally system
	dependant Transport layer.

	* The Transport layer is where the communictions routines
	are implemented.  The transport layer is where drivers for
	various connection types are added.  The first driver to be
	implemented will be a shared memory driver. 
	 
	

This design covers the application,interface & transport layers only.
