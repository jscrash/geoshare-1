a 'C' language data structure defining  entities that may be transferred between applications
Handle - 
Host -
 computer system where a GeoShare CM  and at least one application resides
Key - 
a data item that uniquely identifies a database entity.
Receiver -
 a client application partcipating in GeoShare that is the target of data sent by another client application
Server - 
a client application driver that acts as a bridge between applications
Slot -
a region of shared memory, owned by CM, that is assigned to a client applicantion for use as a message delivery mechanism.
Static Registration - 
the method by which CM recognizes client applications.  Information about a client is entered into the CM database where it remains fixed until updated.
