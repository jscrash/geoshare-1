<ON bo>Introduction<BO type_rev><eop>
<inp>The GeoShare facility is a method by which participating geoscientific app
lications may share data with each other in a Client / Server integration model
.  Vendors may participate in the GeoShare system by making two processes avail
able to their customers.  The first is the data receiver known within GeoShare 
as the <ON it>Service<IT type_rev> process.  The second is the data provider kn
own as the <ON it>Client<IT type_rev> process.   The data provider, <ON it>Clie
nt<IT type_rev> process, may be provided as a separate application or integrate
d directly within the vendor's application.  The data receiver, <ON it>Service<
IT type_rev> process, is provided as a separate process that may be started by 
a GeoShare Connection Manager as defined in the <ON it>GeoShare Software Design
<IT type_rev> document.<eop>
<ON bo>Scope<BO type_rev><eop>
<inp>This document describes the Data Layer of the GeoShare facility as describ
ed in the <ON it>GeoShare Architectural Description<IT type_rev> document.  The
 Data Layer is between the User Interface Layer, which manages all of the <ON i
t>Client's<IT type_rev> interaction with the user and the Communications Layer 
which provides all of the interprocess communication facilities for the Data La
yer.<eop>
<inp>This document is intended for the developer of a GeoShare application, eit
her a data receiver <ON it>Service<IT type_rev> or a data provider <ON it>Clien
t<IT type_rev>.<eop>
<pe><ON bo>Overview<BO type_rev><eop>
<inp>The Data Layer's responsibility is to take the data specifications given b
y the user, read a proprietary database and load interface structures which are
 sent to the Communications Layer. It is also responsible for breaking up the h
ierarchical structure trees into individual structures that are acceptable to t
he Communications Layer.  The structure tree is regenerated in the receiving <O
N it>Service<IT type_rev> in its own Data Layer using tokens embedded in the st
ructures by the sending <ON it>Client's<IT type_rev> Data Layer.<eop>
<inp>The structures are built from two descriptions which are read at run time.
  The physical description of a structure and the data description of the struc
ture.<eop>
<inp>The physical description of a structure includes the data type and byte le
ngth of each element of the structure along with the location of each element w
ithin the structure for a given version of the structure.  The physical descrip
tion is contained in the <ON it>Structure Definition Table<IT type_rev>, or SDT
.<eop>
<inp>The data description of the structure indicates the location of each eleme
nt of the structure within the proprietary database of the vendor suppling the 
sender or receiver process.  The data description is contained in the <ON it>Da
ta Location Table<IT type_rev>, or DLT.<eop>
<inp>The SDT and DLT may exist as relations in the local database of each proce
ss or as flat files readable by the sender and receiver processes.<eop>
<pe><ON bo>Structure Definition Table<BO type_rev><eop>
<inp>This section describes how a typical structure is encoded in the SDT.<eop>

<inp>First, each element in the structure is given an ID number.  The ID number
 is unique for the element and the version of the structure.  That is, whenever
 an element is modified in type, size, or location it will get a new element ID
 and the structure itself will get the next version number.<eop>
<inp><pe><inp>Next, the SDT is filled out as shown in this diagram.<eop>
<inp>The <ON it>element id<IT type_rev> field matches the element ids assigned 
to each element of the structure as shown in the previous diagram.<eop>
<inp>The <ON it>version number<IT type_rev> field is the version number for the
 entire structure.  If any element of the structure is modified in any way the 
entire structure will be given a new version number and each element will be gi
ven a new entry with the new version number.  The modified element or elements 
will be given new element ids.  The original entries will remain intact.  <ON b
o>No entries will <ON it>ever<IT type_rev> be deleted from this table.<BO type_
rev><eop>
<inp><ON it>Member number<IT type_rev> indicates the position of the element wi
thin the structure.  A member number of zero indicates a structure that is not 
directly part of a hierarchy, it may be referenced by a pointer within another 
structure however.  See the description of the pointer reference field.<eop>
<inp><ON it>Parent id<IT type_rev> indicates the hierarchy of elements.  The pa
rent id of any atomic element is the id of the structure of which it is a part.
  The parent id of a top level structure is zero.<eop>
<inp><ON it>Type<IT type_rev> indicates the data type of the element.  The type
s actually appearing in the table may not necessarily relate to data types defi
ned in the 'C' language; they are types unique to the GeoShare system.<eop>
<pe><inp><ON it>Element size<IT type_rev> indicates the number of bytes defined
 as the size of the element.  This is not necessarily the size actually allocat
ed in memory due to the differences in various machine architectures.  This fie
ld is only used for atomic types such as int and double, composite types will h
ave zero in this field.<eop>
<inp><ON it>Pointer reference<IT type_rev> indicates the id number of the struc
ture pointed to by a pointer type element.  This field is only used for element
s which point to other structure types.<eop>
<inp><ON it>Name<IT type_rev> is the character string used as the variable name
 of the element in the structure definition.<eop>
<pe><ON bo>Data Location Table<BO type_rev><eop>
<inp>The DLT is provided by each vendor of a GeoShare application, either a dat
a sender or a receiver.  This table describes the location within the applicati
on's database of each data element in the GeoShare interface structures.  This 
section describes how the sample structure would be encoded in the DLT.<eop>
<eop>
<eop>
<eop>
<inp>The <ON it>element id<IT type_rev> field matches the element ids assigned 
to each element of the structure as described earlier.<eop>
<inp>The <ON it>version number<IT type_rev> field is the version number for the
 entire structure as described in the previous section.<eop>
<inp>The <ON it>relation name<IT type_rev> field indicates the name of a databa
se table in which the data item will either be retrieved from or stored into.  
For applications not using a relational database this field may contain any inf
ormation needed by the application to store the data item.<eop>
<pe><inp>The <ON it>column name<IT type_rev> field indicated the name of a colu
mn in the database table in which the data item will either be retrieved from o
r stored into.  For applications not using a relational database this field may
 contain any information needed by the application to store the data item.<eop>

<inp>The <ON it>key element list<IT type_rev> field indicates which element id 
or element ids constitute the unique key used to identify row in the database t
able in which this element can be found.  For applications not using a relation
al database this field may be unused or contain anything required by the applic
ation to identify the data item location.<eop>
<pe><ON bo>Data Passing Methods and Protocol<eop>
<BO type_rev><inp>Sender and Receiver programs in the GeoShare system will be w
ritten using the 'C' structures defined in the GeoScience.h header file.  <eop>

<inp>This approach provides a simple and familiar interface for programmers wri
ting these programs.  By utilizing the structures directly in applications, pro
grammers are able to dictate flexibly the mapping of their data onto the geosci
ence model.<eop>
<ON bo>Data Structure <BO type_rev><ON bo>Dependency<BO type_rev><eop>
<inp>Since programs will reference the structures directly, they will be inhere
ntly dependant on particular versions of the structure definitions they use.<eo
p>
<inp>The GeoShare interface structures must be maintained in a fashion such tha
t programs written for the system do not become obsolete or cease to function w
hen additions are made to the structure definitions they use.<eop>
<inp>This problem is primarily handled in the same fashion that system structur
e definition dependency is handled.  Consider the system header file stdio.h.  
Additions to the standard FILE data structure are extremely rare, but when they
 are required they are added to the bottom of the structure such that older pro
grams can still be compatible by referencing just a subset of the structure.  C
hanges made to widely published data structures like the FILE structure are mad
e only in a carefully arbitrated fashion mediated by a central standards commit
tee that is responsible for re-publishing the definition to users.<eop>
<inp>There are several fairly obvious policies to observe that will greatly sim
plify the task of maintaining compatibility between various data structure defi
nition versions:<eop>
<inp><inp>1)<inp>New structure members must be added only to the bottom of stru
cture definitions.<eop>
<inp><inp>2)<inp>Existing members must never be deleted or have their data type
 changed.  If a member type becomes obsolete, a new version of it must be added
 to the bottom of the structure.<eop>
<inp><inp>3)<inp>Definitions of structure members must remain statically positi
oned relative to the start of the structure.  Reorganization of, or insertion i
nto existing  definitions is not allowed.<eop>
<inp><inp>4)<inp>Structure type names must never be changed. <eop>
<inp>If the above rules are observed when modifying the geoscience header defin
itions, existing GeoShare programs can be utilized without having to be modifie
d or re-linked.<eop>
<inp>Programs written for different versions of the interface structures can be
 used together with the following considerations:<eop>
<inp><inp>·<inp>Receiver programs  written with a given version of the interfac
e structures may interact only with Senders using the same or newer structure v
ersions.  A Receiver that is written against new structure definitions cannot i
nteract with a Sender that uses older structure definitions unless the receiver
 does not reference the data objects unique to the new version of the structure
.<eop>
<eop>
<inp><inp>·<inp>Sender programs should be written to inquire what version of th
e interface structures the Receiver they are connected to can handle.  Senders 
should be designed to handle sending data subsets when appropriate.  This means
 that any data types that are unique to the sending application's newer version
 of the interface structures must be omitted from the transfer.  This special p
rocessing might require user interface interaction.<eop>
<inp><inp><ON it>Example<IT type_rev>:<eop>
<inp><inp><inp>Given the receivers: rv1 and rv2 and the senders: sv1 and sv2 th
e following transfers are compatible and do not require any special compatibili
ty handling logic:<eop>
<inp><inp><inp><inp>sv1 -<ra> rv1<eop>
 <inp><inp><inp><inp>sv1 -<ra> rv2<eop>
<inp><inp><inp><inp>sv2 -<ra> rv2 <eop>
<inp><inp><inp>The following transfer is not legitimate unless special processi
ng is performed by the sender/receiver to determine a compatible data subset:<e
op>
<inp><inp><inp><inp>sv2 -<ra> rv1<eop>
<pe><ON bo>Structure Splitting and Sending Protocol<BO type_rev><eop>
<inp>The following is an outline of the structure passing protocol and the poli
cies that support it.<eop>
<inp>There are policies regarding how and when data is sent from the Sender to 
the Receiver.  These policies exist to enforce a protocol that is designed to f
acilitate large data transfers without requiring special resource capacities on
 either side of the connection.<eop>
<inp>The protocol defines how interface data structures are split up before bei
ng transferred.  Structures are considered to be composed of two types of entit
ies: Atoms and Pointers.<eop>
<inp>An Atom is any member that is stored directly in the structure itself  whi
le a Pointer is a member stored in the structure by reference such as a vector 
or a pointer to a substructures.<eop>
<inp>Structures sent by one application to another are processed in the followi
ng manner:<eop>
<inp><inp>·<inp>All Pointer members in the structure are replaced by tags that 
are numerically sequential. I.e. the first Pointer member encountered would be 
assigned TAG1 the next would be assigned TAG2 and so on.<eop>
<inp><inp>·<inp>The remaining structure containing only Atoms and tags is trans
ferred.<eop>
<inp><inp>·<inp>Each Pointer member tagged in the structure is processed and se
nt in the same sequence as tagged.  The processing of the Pointer members is th
e same as the initial processing of the structure: Each Pointer member is tagge
d and sent afterwards.<eop>
<inp>Note that the processing of structures is represented as a pre-order tree 
traversal:<eop>
<inp>First the root structure is processed to Atoms and sent.  The next transfe
r after the root will be the first tagged pointer.  If the pointer being proces
sed contains pointers, they are processed and sent directly after the root poin
ter and so on.  Finally, the next pointer tagged in the root structure is proce
ssed and sent and so on.<eop>
<inp>The processing of structures is a recursive operation and results in a pre
dictable ordering of data transfer such that receivers can always know what con
text received data is in.<eop>
<pe><ON bo>Transfer Types<BO type_rev><eop>
<inp>Sending a data structure involves one or more transfers. There are several
 classes of transfer:<eop>
<inp><inp>·<inp>StructRootClass<eop>
<inp><inp>·<inp>StructTagClass<eop>
<inp><inp>·<inp>VectorTagClass<eop>
<inp>The <ON it>StructRootClass<IT type_rev> marks the beginning of a new trans
fer and the sending of the root data structure (atoms only).<eop>
<inp>The <ON it>StructTagClass<IT type_rev> marks the transfer of a structure p
ointer tagged within the parent structure.<eop>
<inp>The <ON it>VectorTagClass<IT type_rev> marks the transfer of a vector tagg
ed within the parent structure.<eop>
<ON bo><eop>
Transfer States<BO type_rev><eop>
<inp>A data transfer may be in any one of the following states:<eop>
<inp><inp>START_OF_ROOT<eop>
<inp><inp>END_OF_ROOT<eop>
<inp><inp>START_OF_STRUCT_TAG<eop>

<pe><ON bo>Structure Splitting and Traversal Example<BO type_rev><eop>
<inp>The algorithm for splitting up the data before sending is as follows:<eop>
