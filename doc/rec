Data Receivers
-------------

For each application that is to receive data in a GeoShare system
there must exist a data receiver program.  These programs are
supplied by the parties who wish to participate in GeoShare
A data reciever program is started on demand by the connection 
manager using a standardized method for supplying arguments known 
as 'context management'.  

The arguments that a data receiver needs for initialization are
supplied by the connection manager which looks up the data receiver
program in its configuration file.  The configuration file contains
the argument list in the form:

	"User Prompt","Program argument keyword","type"

for instance:
	"Project name?","-project","string"

The user interface on the client side is sent the prompt and the
response is sent back to the CM and appended to the program argument
keyword and finally used in a command line invocation for starting
the data receiver process.
