	A) locked/unlocked/available
	B) target - CM,CL,RC,free
	C) Buffer Size
	D) Message Length
	E) Message Buffer


The sequence for placing a message in a process slot is the same for
all processes, and is as follows:

	* Processes only access a slot when its lock flag indicates
	that the slot is unlocked.

	* The target flag is checked and if the state indicates Free
	then a message is written into the message buffer and the target
	for the message is written into the target flag.
	If the target flag does not indicate that the slot is Free 
	and the target is not the current process then the process 
	abandons the slot and waits again for the slot to be unlocked.

	* The lock flag is waited upon until it indicates that the
	slot is unlocked.

	* The busy flag is checked, and if set the process waits
	until it is cleared.

	* The busy flag is set.

	* The message is written to the message buffer.

	* the length of the message is placed in the message length
	member of the slot.

	* The direction flag is set to indicate the recipient of the
	message.

	* The busy flag is unset.
	
When a process wants to place a message in its slot it must first
wait until the busy flag is unset, it then sets the busy flag as
well as the flag indicating which direction the message is going.
Finally, the busy flag is cleared.  The connection manager scans the
process slots in a circular fashion checking for slots that do not
indicate a busy state and which have a direction flag indicating
CMREAD.  The connection manager places a reply message by setting
the busy flag, writing the message in the message buffer, setting
the direction flag to the direction indicating the intended reader
of the message and finally unsetting the busy flag.
