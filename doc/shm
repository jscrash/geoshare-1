Shared Memory Allococation
--------------------------

The Geolink shared memory tool box consists of two routines:

	alloc		- Allocate a shared memory region.
	free		- Free a shared memory region.


These routines allocate and free shared memory resources.  The alloc
routine behaves similarly to the C library routine 'malloc' except
that it requires a key identifier to specifiy a handle to the region
allocated.  This key is used by routines that wish to attach to a
shared memory region created by a different routine or process. 

Routine Specification
---------------------

void *gs_alloc(size,key)
	INPUT:
		int size	- Minimum number of bytes to allocate.
		int key		- Unique key to identify region.
	OUTPUT:
		The function returns a pointer to a shared memory
		region.


void gs_free(ptr)
	INPUT:
		void *Ptr	- Pointer to region of memory to release.
	OUTPUT:
		none.  This is a void function.
